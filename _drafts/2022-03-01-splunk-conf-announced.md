Splunk's .conf was announced today. As opposed to previous years where the Splunk user conference was held later in the year, this time Splunk decided to host it in June 12th and 16th in Las Vegas. This event will, hopefully, be the 1st to held both in person and virtual since the COVID pandemic hit the globe and forced companies cancel all gatherings for the last 2 years.
